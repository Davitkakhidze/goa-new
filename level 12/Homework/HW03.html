    <h2>The Sea Tigers (Tamil: கடற்புலிகள் Kaţaṛpulikaḷ) was the naval wing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the Sri Lankan Civil War. It was founded in 1984.[4] The Sea Tigers had a number of small but effective suicide bomber vessels.[5] During its existence it had gained a reputation as a capable adversary for the Sri Lankan Navy.[6] During the civil war, the Sea Tigers had sunk at least 29 Sri Lankan small inshore patrol boats, 20 Dvora-class fast patrol boats, 3 gunboats, 2 large surveillance command ships, and one freighter.[citation needed][7]</h2>
